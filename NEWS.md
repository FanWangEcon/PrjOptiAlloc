# PrjOptiAlloc (development version)

## 0.1.3

* Code changes related to revisions for [Nygaard, Sorensen and Wang (2021)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3839890). This paper now focuses on stimulus checks more generally, in contrast to [Nygaard, Sorensen and Wang (2020)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3691091), which focused on COVID-related stimulus checks policies.
* Some functions added to handle allocation and results graphing.
* Some functions added to handle relevant issues for the Bush era stimulus checks.

## 0.1.2

* Added Input and Graph processing functions for [Nygaard, Sorensen and Wang (2020)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3691091) to support processing matlab output to solve for the optimal allocations of welfare checks.
* Tested with R 4.0.2

## 0.1.1

* Main paper functions completed. Tested and initially implemented with various [Vignettes](https://fanwangecon.github.io/PrjOptiAlloc/articles/index.html) and implemented as various [functions](https://fanwangecon.github.io/REconTools/reference/index.html)
* Tested with R 4.0.0
