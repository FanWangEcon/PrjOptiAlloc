\usage{
data(df_opt_caschool_prep_i)
}
\description{
\eqn{\text{ID}_i}: individual id
\eqn{D^{\text{max}}_{i}}: maximimum discrete allocation each person, in addition to existing levels
\eqn{D^{\text{o}}_{i}}: what I call observed allocation, just any comparison allocation,
in addition to existing levels, this is the additional allocation (ignoring existing levels),
this is the not the total allocation. If fully redistributing, this could be the observed level of allocation.
\eqn{\Omega_{i}}: This is the expected outcome when the input of interest is completely zero,
\eqn{\Omega_{i}\neq A_{i,l=0}}, because \eqn{l=0} does not mean input is zero, using \eqn{\Omega_i} rather
than \eqn{A_i} to avoid confusion because \eqn{A_i} sounds like \eqn{A_i = A_{i, l=0}}, but again, the problem
does not start with allocation at zero, but each district already has some existing number of teachers.
\eqn{\theta_{i}}: coefficient in front of student teacher ratio
\eqn{\beta_{i}}: i specific preference
\eqn{\text{enrltot}_{i}}: enrollment per district/school, assume no within district variations
\eqn{\text{teachers}_{i}}: teacher per distrct/school
\eqn{\text{stravg}_{i}}: average of student teacher ratio district/school
