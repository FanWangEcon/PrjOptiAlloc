### [Beyond the Classroom: The Implications of School Vouchers for Church Finances](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/rest_a_00782)

Governments have used vouchers to spend billions of dollars on private education; much of this has gone to religiously affiliated schools. We explore the possibility that vouchers could alter the financial outcomes of religious organizations that are operating schools and thus have an impact on the spiritual, moral, and social fabric of communities. Using a data set of Catholic parish finances from Milwaukee, we show that vouchers are a dominant source of funding for many churches. Vouchers appear to offer financial stability for congregations as voucher expansion prevents church closures and mergers. However, voucher expansion causes significant declines in church donations and church revenue from noneducational sources.

Our baseline specification takes the form

yit=δvoucherit+βXit+θi+φt+Tit+εit,
where yit is an outcome variable for parish i in year t, such as actual voucher revenue, school expenditures or revenue, nonschool expenditures or revenue, or offertory revenue. The variable voucherit is potential voucher revenue for parish i in year t, Xit is a set of controls for community characteristics, θi is a set of parish fixed effects, φt is a set of year dummies, and Tit is a set of parish-specific time trends. The term εit is noise.
